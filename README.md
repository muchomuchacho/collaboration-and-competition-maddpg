## Project Details

For this project, you will work with the [Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

![Trained Agent][image1]

In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1.  If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01.  Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation.  Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single **score** for each episode.

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those **scores** is at least +0.5.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the following link for instructions on how to set up your environment: [instructions](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies)
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, using the virtual environment created in the previous step, to install the remaining of the required dependencies.

3. The environment included in this repository is for the Linux platform only. See
below for environments for other platforms:

## Instructions

- Once the requirements detailed above are satisfied run the following command to
train the Agent:\
`python maddpg.py`
- To run the Agent in eval mode we need to pass the checkpoint files as a CLI argument:\
`python maddpg.py --chkp actor`
- Run the following command for further details:\
`python maddpg.py -h`
